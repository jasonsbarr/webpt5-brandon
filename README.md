# Shared Resources for Lambda School PT Web PM Group

This repo is for links to articles, tutorials, software packages, and other resources the members of our Lambda School PM group led by Brandon Desselle.

## Contents

- [Guidelines](#guidelines)
- [Helpful practices](#helpful-practices)
- [Effective learning](#effective-learning)
- [Project ideas](#project-ideas)

## Guidelines

Add new categories as needed then add a link to the menu above, nesting list items as appropriate.

To create a link to an in-page fragment in GitHub, use the following syntax:

```markdown
- [Anchor Text](#anchor-text)
```

If you don't know what value to use for the anchor text, hovering over the heading with your mouse will cause a link icon to appear. The link icon will show you the URL to link to. Note that all you need to put in parentheses to format the link properly is the hash value.

## Helpful practices

- [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)

- [You know what you write: the textbook method](http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/08/10/you-know-what-you-write-the-textbook-method-for-ultra-learning/)
